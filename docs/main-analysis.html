<p>The model parameters report effects of one-unit (e.g. one hour per day) changes in the predictor on the outcome. We also expand on this by first asking what is the effect of an average deviation in a predictor on the outcome. That is, for example, we calculate the average range of players’ average daily hours played, and then answer what the effect of an average player moving from their smallest to greatest amount of play would be on well-being.</p>

<p>We then turn to a second question, how much would the average player need to increase their play to result in a subjectively noticeable effect. Anvari and Lakens estimated that a 2% movement might be a lower limit to a subjectively noticeable change in well-being using a similar measurement scale.</p>
<p>We calculate, for each predictor and outcome, how much the predictor would need to change in order to elicit a change in the outcome greater than the subjective threshold. e.g. How many more hours would one need to play to “feel it”.</p>

<p>Comparing subjective hours estimates to objective play behaviour is complicated by the fact that a missing value in objective behaviour indicates zero hours of play, whereas a missing value in estimated time can indicate either an estimated lack of play, or a missing response (e.g. player declined to respond to this item). Therefore any comparison here is done only on individuals who provided subjective estimate data.</p>
